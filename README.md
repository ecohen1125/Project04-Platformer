# Project04-Platformer

# Project Name
Mountain Mayhem

## Description
This is a 2D platformer that has different enemy types. It has one large level.

## Implementation

Changed the graphics of the level and background

Created one big level with a background and a little challenge to get to the end of it

Added a health system that ends the game if you run out of life (start with 3)

Created a player and implemented new graphics with animations

Created 3 enemy types: one that charges at the player when they are close, one that starts jumping towards the player when they are close, and one that walks between two walls with animations for all

Added background music

There are coins around the level that add to the player's score. Killing an enemy also adds to the score

Added a pause menu when the escape key is pressed

Created a main menu, and a win screen and lose screen

Added a zone under the map that destroys anything that touches it to clean up the level. If the player touches it, they are reset to the beginning
